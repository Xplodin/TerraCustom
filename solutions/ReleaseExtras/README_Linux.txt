Install Instructions: Make a 'TerraCustom' folder next to the Terraria install folder and place the .zip contents in it.

To Run: Run the TerraCustom file (not TerraCustom.exe)

If it doesn't run, you might need to give execute permissions to the TerraCustom file. To do this, open a terminal in the install directory and run this command:
    chmod +x TerraCustom

Why are there EXE files?:
Don't worry about it, you didn't download the wrong thing.

How to find your Install Location:

  Default Steam: ".local/share/Steam/steamapps/common/Terraria"

  Non-Default Steam: Use the browse local files option within steam to locate your install folder. If you can't find it, view this video: https://gfycat.com/SelfreliantAssuredIsabellineshrike

  GOG: Wherever you put it

Note: "~/.local/share/Terraria" or "$XDG_DATA_HOME/Terraria" are NOT your install folder, they are your SAVE folder. Terra Custom NEEDS to be placed next to the install folder to work.
